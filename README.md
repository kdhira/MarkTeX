# MarkTeX

MarkTeX is a text parsing application that's aim is to convert easy to write Markdown text into a LaTeX document. It was designed to be used in conjunction with note writing at university so that I can type up content from lectures quickly and have it output in a nicely laid out document without much formatting hassle.

#### Prerequisites:
Using MarkTeX requires installation of a TeX/LaTeX distribution, as MarkTeX will only generate LaTeX code and will not compile the code on its own. It is free, and available for most (if not all) major operating systems. You can find out more by visiting their website: [https://www.latex-project.org/get/](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
